# Motivation

Whether you're a data scientist, engineer, or data visualizer, you've probably run into a case where you want to quickly analyze and understand a dataset by calculating distributions of values, outliers, completeness, and other statistics.

vcli aims to integrate into existing command line workflows with support for piping in data, while also providing the richness & flexibility of browser-based visualizations.

# Install

### Installing via npm

1. Install node.js via [package manager](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/#macos) or [download](https://nodejs.org/en/download/), if you haven't already.

2. Install the vcli package globally

```sh-session
$ npm install -g @vcli-org/vcli
```

### Standalone Installer

A standalone installer is currently only available for Mac, contributions [to add Windows support](https://github.com/schnerd/vcli/issues/3) for adding Windows support) are welcomed.

Visit the [releases page](https://github.com/schnerd/vcli/releases) to find the latest installer for your system.

# Usage

```
USAGE
  $ vcli [FILE]
  $ program | vcli

OPTIONS
  -h, --help           show CLI help
  -v, --version        show CLI version

  -x, --x-axis=x-axis  Column index/name to plot on x-axis of charts. For date fields you can specify an aggregate function like start_date:month
                       (supports day/month/year)

  -y, --y-axis=y-axis  Column index/name to plot on y-axis of charts. You can also specify an aggregate function like sales:sum (supports
                       count/min/max/sum/mean/median/p5/p95)

  --facet=facet        Column index/name that will be used to group data into separate charts
  --port=port          Port to run the local webserver on (default is 8888)
```

vcli does not store or send any of your data over the internet â€“ everything takes place on your local machine.

Because it visualizes your data using a browser, it is not useful during remote sessions like ssh or other headless environments.

# Examples

#### Launch "Overview" visualization with stats & distributions for all columns

```
$ vcli data.csv
```

#### Launch "Analysis" visualization with specified configuration

```
$ vcli -x date:month -y cases:sum --facet state data.csv
```

#### Pipe CSV data from an API into vcli

```
$ curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/master/us-counties.csv | vcli
```

#### Pipe CSV data from another program into vcli

```
$ python my-csv-generator.py | vcli
```

# Troubleshooting

### Working with very large files

By default Node.js processes have 512mb of memory, if you are processing a very large file you could run into out of memory errors like the following:

```
FATAL ERROR: CALL_AND_RETRY_LAST Allocation failed - JavaScript heap out of memory
```

You can increase this memory limit by prepending your vcli command with an extra option:

```
export NODE_OPTIONS="--max_old_space_size=8192" && vcli ...
```

The above command would allow the node process to use up to 8gb of memory while it's running.
