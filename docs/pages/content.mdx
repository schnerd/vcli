# Motivation

Whether you're a data scientist, engineer, or data visualizer, you've probably run into a case where you want to quickly analyze and understand a dataset by calculating distributions of values, outliers, completeness, and other statistics.

vcli aims to integrate into existing command line workflows with support for piping in data, while also providing the richness & flexibility of browser-based visualizations.

# Install

### Installing via npm

1. Install node.js via [package manager](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/#macos) or [download](https://nodejs.org/en/download/), if you haven't already.

2. Install the vcli package globally

```sh-session
$ npm install -g vcli
```

# Usage

```
USAGE
  $ vcli [FILE]
  $ program | vcli

OPTIONS
  -h, --help           show CLI help
  -v, --version        show CLI version

  -x, --x-axis=x-axis  Column index/name to plot on x-axis of charts. For date fields you can specify an aggregate function like start_date:month
                       (supports day/month/year)

  -y, --y-axis=y-axis  Column index/name to plot on y-axis of charts. You can also specify an aggregate function like sales:sum (supports
                       min/max/sum/mean/median/p5/p95)

  --facet=facet        Column index/name that will be used to group data into separate charts
```

# Examples

#### Launch "Overview" visualization with stats & distributions for all columns

```
$ vcli data.csv
```

#### Launch "Analysis" visualization with specified configuration

```
$ vcli -x date:month -y cases:sum --facet state data.csv
```

#### Pipe CSV data from an API into vcli

```
$ curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/master/us-counties.csv | vcli
```

#### Pipe CSV data from another program into vcli

```
$ python my-csv-generator.py | vcli
```
